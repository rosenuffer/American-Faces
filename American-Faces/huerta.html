  <h1>Dolores Huerta</h1>
  <main><p>Dedicating her life to advocating for the rights of farmworkers and marginalized communities, Dolores Huerta fought to make America a better place for its common people.
    As a co-founder of the United Farm Workers and a relentless organizer,
    she led strikes, fought for fair wages, and championed women's rights. Huerta's unwavering commitment and remarkable achievements continue to inspire and remind us of the
    power of collective action in creating a more just and equitable world. She founded the Dolores Huerta Foundation, which you can visit <a href="https://www.doloreshuerta.org/">here</a>
