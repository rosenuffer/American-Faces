  <h1>Lewis Hine</h1>
  <main><p>
    Lewis Hine, a pioneering photographer and social reformer, used his camera to expose the harsh realities of child labor and advocate for change. 
    His compelling images, some of which you can view <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/national-child-labor-committee/about-this-collection/" target="_blank">here,</a>
    played a crucial role in raising awareness, shaping labor laws, and giving a voice to the marginalized. 
    Hine's work continues to inspire and remind us of the transformative power of photography in addressing social issues.
